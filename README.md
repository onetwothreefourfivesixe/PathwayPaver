# PathwayPaver

Pathway Paver is a puzzle game where the player must guide cars to their destinations by placing road tiles on a grid. The game challenges players to use limited resources (tiles and turns) to solve increasingly complex levels while avoiding obstacles like trees.

This project was created by [onetwothreefourfivesixe](https://github.com/onetwothreefourfivesixe) and [NHere24](https://github.com/NHere24) for the 2025 McLean Hackathon where we won first place.

## Features

- **Multiple Levels:** Progress through predefined levels with unique layouts and challenges.
- **Tile Placement:** Strategically place road tiles to create paths for cars.
- **Turn Limit:** Complete each level within a limited number of turns.
- **Obstacles:** Avoid trees (dark green tiles) that block road placement.
- **Dynamic Cars:** Cars move in order, and their direction is indicated by a blue windshield.
- **Destination Houses:** Cars must reach their color-matched houses (represented as houses on the grid).
- **Level Selection:** Replay completed levels or select unlocked levels from the level selection screen.
- **Help Screen:** Learn how to play with an accessible help screen.
